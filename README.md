## To-Do

Graph algorithms for community detection as a proxy for voter share. Look into how to extend twitter demographic sample to more general population (research XBOX polling study). 


## Considerations for Future Projects

The rate of tweets streaming in was too much for my computer to manage and required frequent resetting. Look at optimizing code to better keep up with the stream, or at storing temporarily in another data structure before importing into graph database.
